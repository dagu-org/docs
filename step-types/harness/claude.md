# Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) is Anthropic's agentic coding tool that lets you collaborate with Claude directly from your terminal.

## Installation

See the [official installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview).

For containerized Dagu runs, see [Run Claude Code in a Container](./sandbox/claude-code).

## Base Invocation

```text
claude -p "<prompt>"
```

## Common Flags

Any `with` key other than `provider` and `fallback` is passed as a CLI flag. Snake-case keys are normalized to kebab-case.

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--model` | string | Model variant (e.g. `sonnet`, `opus`) |
| `--bare` | boolean | Minimal mode: skips hooks, LSP, plugin sync, auto-memory, `CLAUDE.md` discovery, and keychain reads |
| `--max-turns` | number | Maximum tool-calling iterations |

`bare: true` skips keychain reads, so a subscription login is not visible to the
step and the run fails with `Not logged in · Please run /login`. Use it only
when the credential comes from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the step environment.

## Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: review-pr
    action: harness.run
    with:
      provider: claude
      prompt: |
        Review the current branch for bugs and style issues
      model: sonnet
```

Generated invocation:

```text
claude -p "Review the current branch for bugs and style issues" --model sonnet
```

## YOLO Mode

By default, Claude Code asks for approval before running commands. In a Dagu workflow this is not possible, so you should run in non-interactive mode:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: auto-refactor
    action: harness.run
    with:
      provider: claude
      prompt: |
        Refactor the auth module
      dangerously_skip_permissions: true
```

Generated invocation:

```text
claude -p "Refactor the auth module" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Warning:** This skips all safety checks. Only use in isolated or trusted environments.

## Approval Push-back

When combined with Dagu's approval gates, Claude Code steps can be reviewed and iterated:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: implement
    action: harness.run
    with:
      provider: claude
      prompt: |
        Implement the requested feature
      model: opus
    approval:
      prompt: "Review the implementation"
      input: [FEEDBACK]
```

On push-back, the prompt is augmented with reviewer feedback and the previous stdout log path.
