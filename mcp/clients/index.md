# MCP Clients

Dagu's MCP server is built into the Dagu HTTP server, so client setup means adding Dagu's Streamable HTTP endpoint to the tool. There is nothing to install per client.

## Before You Start

```bash
export DAGU_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8080/mcp
export DAGU_MCP_API_KEY=dagu_...
```

Use the HTTPS URL for a remote or shared Dagu server. See [Quickstart](/mcp/quickstart) for the URL table and [Authentication](/mcp/authentication) for key roles and surfaces.

## Pick Your Client

| Client | Page |
|--------|------|
| Claude Code | [Claude Code](./claude-code) |
| Codex | [Codex](./codex) |
| Cursor | [Cursor](./cursor) |
| VS Code and GitHub Copilot | [VS Code](./vscode) |
| Gemini CLI | [Gemini CLI](./gemini-cli) |
| OpenCode | [OpenCode](./opencode) |
| Zed | [Zed](./zed) |
| Cline | [Cline](./cline) |
| Windsurf | [Windsurf](./windsurf) |
| Claude Desktop and claude.ai | [Claude Apps](./claude-apps) |
| Anything else | [Other Clients](./other-clients) |

For a repository-wide setup that teammates share, see [Team Setup](./team-setup).

## Configuration Shapes

Clients agree on the concepts and disagree on the field names. This table is the fastest way to translate an example from one client to another.

| Client | Configuration | Endpoint field | Header auth | Secret from environment |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Claude Code | `claude mcp add`, `.mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json` | `"type": "http"` with `url` | Yes | `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}` |
| Codex | `codex mcp add`, `~/.codex/config.toml` | `url` | Bearer only, from an environment variable | `bearer_token_env_var` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | `url` | Yes | `${env:VAR}` |
| VS Code | `.vscode/mcp.json`, user `mcp.json` | `"type": "http"` with `url` | Yes | `${input:id}` prompt |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini mcp add`, `settings.json` | `httpUrl` | Yes | `$VAR`, `${VAR}` |
| OpenCode | `opencode.json` | `"type": "remote"` with `url` | Yes | `{env:VAR}` |
| Zed | `settings.json` | `url` | Yes | Not documented, value is literal |
| Cline | Cline MCP settings JSON | `"type": "streamableHttp"` with `url` | Yes | Not documented, value is literal |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `serverUrl` | Yes | `${env:VAR}` |
| Claude Desktop and claude.ai | Connectors UI | Remote MCP server URL | No, OAuth or unauthenticated only | Not applicable |

Two field names cause most failures: Gemini CLI uses `httpUrl` for Streamable HTTP and reserves `url` for SSE, and Windsurf uses `serverUrl` instead of `url`.

## Transport

Dagu serves Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` and does not expose an SSE endpoint. Clients that only speak stdio or SSE need the `mcp-remote` bridge described in [Other Clients](./other-clients).

## Verify Any Client

After the client connects, three tools should be listed:

- `dagu_read`
- `dagu_change`
- `dagu_execute`

A good first read is the built-in authoring reference:

```text
dagu://reference/authoring
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or wrong API key, key not accepted on the `mcp` surface, or a role without the needed permission. See [Authentication](/mcp/authentication). |
| `404 Not Found` | Server base path missing from the URL. A server mounted at `/dagu` exposes MCP at `/dagu/mcp`. |
| Client reports a missing command or a stdio server | The entry has a URL but no transport type. Add the client's HTTP type field. |
| Client connects but no tools appear | The key's role is too narrow, or the client cached an earlier failed session. Reconnect the server. |
| Client only supports SSE or stdio | Use the [`mcp-remote` bridge](./other-clients#stdio-only-clients). |
| Tools appear but every call fails against a remote server | The client cannot reach the Dagu URL. Confirm the host, port, and TLS from the machine running the client. |
