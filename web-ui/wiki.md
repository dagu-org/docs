# Wiki

Wiki keeps operational knowledge next to the workflows it explains. Use the Web UI to write Markdown runbooks, troubleshooting notes, handoff guides, and diagrams without leaving Dagu.

## What You Can Do

- organize Markdown files in a nested file tree
- create, rename, move, and delete files and folders
- keep several pages open in tabs
- edit Markdown and preview the rendered result side by side
- render Mermaid diagrams in the preview
- jump through long pages from the generated outline
- search page names and contents
- scope pages to the default or a named workspace
- synchronize pages with a Git repository through [Git Sync](/server-admin/git-sync)

## Browse And Organize Pages

Open **Wiki** from the navigation. The sidebar shows the page tree for the selected workspace.

Use the tree actions to:

- create a page or folder
- rename an item
- drag an item into another folder
- select several items for deletion
- expand or collapse nested folders

Page names use the `.md` extension. Dagu adds it when a new page name omits the extension. A file and a directory cannot have the same path identity, so names such as `runbook.md` and `runbook/` cannot exist side by side.

Moving pages between workspaces is not supported. Select the destination workspace first and create or synchronize the page there.

## Edit And Preview Markdown

Open a page to add it as a tab. The editor provides:

- **Edit** and **Preview** modes
- standard Markdown rendering
- Mermaid diagram rendering
- an outline generated from headings
- `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S` to save

Dagu keeps unsaved content in browser storage so an accidental navigation or reload does not immediately lose the draft. Drafts are separated by authenticated user, remote node, and workspace. Saving or discarding the draft clears the stored copy.

An open page with unsaved changes must be saved before it can be renamed or moved. This keeps the editor buffer attached to the correct file.

When another user or Git Sync changes an open page, the editor reports the external update instead of silently overwriting local edits. Wiki receives live update events when available and falls back to periodic refreshes.

## Workspace Scoping

Wiki follows the workspace selector:

| Selection | Pages shown |
| --- | --- |
| **All workspaces** | Pages from every workspace the account can access. This aggregate view is for browsing and search. |
| **Default** | Pages that are not assigned to a named workspace. |
| **Named workspace** | Only pages owned by that workspace. |

Select **Default** or a specific named workspace before creating, renaming, moving, or deleting content.

On disk, Dagu stores default pages directly under `paths.wiki_dir` and named-workspace pages under a workspace directory:

```text
<paths.wiki_dir>/
|-- operations/
|   `-- runbook.md
`-- platform/
    `-- incident-response.md
```

In this example, `operations/runbook.md` belongs to **Default**, while `platform/incident-response.md` belongs to the `platform` workspace.

Renaming a workspace moves its page tree to the new workspace name. A workspace cannot be deleted while it still contains pages; move or remove those pages first.

See [Workspaces](/web-ui/workspaces) for access rules and lifecycle behavior.

## Search

The Wiki sidebar filters the current tree by file name and page content. Dagu's global **Search** page also returns matching pages and the lines containing the query, subject to workspace access.

## Storage Configuration

The page root is configured with `paths.wiki_dir`:

```yaml
paths:
  dags_dir: /opt/dagu/dags
  wiki_dir: /opt/dagu/dags/wiki
```

The equivalent process configuration variable is `DAGU_WIKI_DIR`. A fresh installation uses `<paths.dags_dir>/wiki` when no value is configured.

Existing installations remain in place: when `wiki` does not exist but the legacy `docs` directory does, Dagu adopts `docs` as the Wiki root. Startup fails if both directories exist so that content is never merged implicitly. The deprecated `paths.docs_dir` and `DAGU_DOCS_DIR` configuration aliases remain accepted with a warning.

See [Configuration](/server-admin/configuration#wiki-directory) for deployment and storage details.

## Use Wiki From A Workflow

Each run receives the page directory for its DAG as `${context.paths.wiki_dir}`. Processes receive the same path as `DAG_WIKI_DIR`.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: print_runbook
    run: cat "${context.paths.wiki_dir}/runbook.md"
```

For a default-workspace DAG named `operations`, the path resolves to `<paths.wiki_dir>/operations`. For the same DAG in the `platform` workspace, it resolves to `<paths.wiki_dir>/platform/operations`.

`DAGU_WIKI_DIR` configures the server-wide page root. `DAG_WIKI_DIR` is the per-DAG path projected into a running step.

The deprecated `${context.paths.docs_dir}`, `${paths.docs_dir}`, and `DAG_DOCS_DIR` aliases resolve to the same directory for existing workflows.

See [Runtime Context and Variables](/writing-workflows/runtime-variables#wiki-directory-contextpathswiki_dir) for the full runtime contract.

## Git Sync

Git Sync tracks pages under `wiki/` in a new repository. Existing repositories with only `docs/` continue using that directory in place. A repository containing both directories is rejected for the same reason as local storage. For example, the local page `operations/runbook.md` in a new repository is represented as:

```text
repository path: wiki/operations/runbook.md
itemId:          wiki/operations/runbook
kind:            doc
```

The `doc` kind is a stable Git Sync wire value and has not changed.

Pulling writes repository pages into the configured page root. Publishing sends Web UI edits back to the repository when Git Sync writes are enabled. See [Git Sync](/server-admin/git-sync) for setup, status, conflicts, and CLI commands.

## Permissions

Authenticated users can browse pages in workspaces they are allowed to access. Creating, saving, renaming, moving, and deleting pages requires `permissions.write_dags` and a write-capable role for the selected workspace.
